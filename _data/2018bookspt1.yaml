  title: "Binti:Home"
  author: "Nnedi Okorafor"
  synopsis: |
    This is the second book in the excellent <i>Binti</i> trilogy. I received the first novella for Christmas in 2017 and read it in the car ride home. The series takes place in a future where Earth's human inhabitants have made contact with civilizations on other planets. Binti is a Himba girl who was accepted to Oomza Uni, located somewhere out in space. The first book, <i>Binti</i>, follows her tumultuous journey from home to Oomza. 
    I was excited to find out that the sequel, <i>Binti: Home</i>, was already out (and that the third and final book <i>Binti: The Night Masquerade</i> was on the way) and so picked it up as soon as possible. </p>
    <p>This book continues building on the wonderful sci-fi future that Okorafor started in the first installment, rife with intergalactic conflict and wild new technologies. After a short slice of Binti's life at Oomza, she boards a spaceship to return home for her pilgrammage. The story that follows is one of returning home after a long time away and experiencing the familiar through an unfamiliar lens. Binti has changed in many ways during her trip, but her home remains relatively unchanged and not necessarily accepting of who she has become. </p>
    <p>I left my home in the suburbs of Pittsburgh for college in 2010, and then moved halfway across the country for a job when I graduated. After a couple of years, I moved back to Pittsburgh for another job. While I haven't brokered galactic peace or gotten any extra-terrestrial DNA mixed up with my own, I had definitely changed as a person in those six years, and it can be weird moving back to a place that may be expecting a different version of you.

  title: "What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins"
  author: "Jonathan Balcombe"
  synopsis: |
    Here is one of the non-fiction books that I finished this year. It walks through various scientific endeavours and anecdotes about the cognitive abilities of various species of fish. Balcombe discusses many walks of fishy life, with chapters on what fish perceive, feel, and think as well as different ways they recognize each other (as well as humans). Sprinkled within are passages that paint the tragedy of this; humans are destroying the oceans at alarming rates, so we may never truly explore the vast potential that ocean life holds.</p>
    <p>Fish look weird and have entirely different brain structures and life experiences than us, so it's easy for people to dismiss their existence. This book helps to illustrate how wrong that is by describing the vibrant and social lives that the ocean's inhabitants lead. Fish engage in play with and show off for each other. They cooperate, communicate, observe, and deceive. They lead strange sex lives, seducing one another with art drawn on the sea floor or laying fake eggs to make sure their partner isn't just looking for a snack.</p>
    <p>Any given species of fish only exhibits a small amount of this behavior, but learning about the sheer diversity of behavior and cognitive ability was captivating, and I'd love to read similar books about other living things. The next one I plan to read is <i>The Genius of Birds</i> by Jennifer Ackerman.

  title: "The Broken Earth Trilogy"
  author: "N. K. Jemisin"
  synopsis: |
    Each installment of this trilogy won a Hugo Award for best sci-fi/fantasy novel of the year (in 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively) and each book deserved the award more than the last. All three are easily some of the best fantasy that I have read. Every so often in a land called the Stillness, an extended winter called a fifth season is brought on by a seismic catastrophe. This time, one of the worst fifth seasons in recorded history has just kicked off, and the world may well be ending again. Ash falls from the sky as it spews from a massive rift that was torn in the middle of the continent.</p>
    <p>Each of the perspective characters in these books is an orogene, which means they can control energy in a lot of ways. Society as a whole treats orogenes as less-than-human, usually reacting violently if they find that a loved one or someone around them posess these abilities. The ones that are spared are sent to a school called the Fulcrum, where they are forcibly taught to control their power. The orogenes that make it through this process are are then saddled with a life of preventing and quelling earthquakes for the very people that revile them. These books present the most well written accounts of systematic oppression I've read in fiction, and the backdrop of magic and worldbuilding that it's set against is very well thought out. </p>
    <p>The stories told here by N.K. Jemisin are incredibly tense and heart-wrenching and I can't praise her writing enough. Read these books.

    Here's the first tabletop RPG on the list this year, and the one that kicked off my interest in "fiction first" style roleplaying games.
