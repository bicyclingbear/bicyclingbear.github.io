My name is Adam. I like to play games, ride my bike, and climb rocks. I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA. I like it here well enough. Once upon a time I studied physics and now I work at an entirely-too-large software company. I made this site to figure out what types of writing I like to do as well as learn some web design.
